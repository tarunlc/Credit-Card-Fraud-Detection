# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection

The code is focused on credit card fraud detection. The goal of the script is to analyze and prepare a dataset of credit card transactions to detect fraudulent activities using machine learning.

Here's a summary of what the code is about:

Data Exploration: The script loads a dataset of credit card transactions and performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the structure, distribution, and characteristics of the data. This includes visualizing various transaction features and analyzing the distribution of fraud and non-fraud transactions.

Data Preparation: The code separates the dataset into features (transaction details) and the target variable (indicating whether a transaction is fraudulent). It then splits the data into training and testing sets, preparing it for model training.

Fraud Detection: The ultimate aim of the script is to use the prepared data to build a machine learning model that can identify fraudulent transactions. The initial steps shown in the code lay the groundwork for this by ensuring that the data is well-understood and properly structured for modeling.
